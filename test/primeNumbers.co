CO prime numbers algorithm CO
co All prime numbers less than the input

begin

  co input value
  prime := 1; co boolean variable become false when not prime
  TWO := 2;
  THREE := 3;
  read(limit);

  CO 
  Not trivial cases
  CO

  if limit > 3 then
    co print two basic prime numbers
    print(TWO);
    print(THREE);

    CO MAIN cODE CO
    co step of 2 because we can ignore even numbers
    for i from 3 by 2 to limit do 
      for j from 3 by 2 to i do 
        if i/j - (i/j)*j = 0 then
          prime := 0
        endif
      endfor;

      if prime = 1 then
        print(i)
      else
        prime := 1
      endif
